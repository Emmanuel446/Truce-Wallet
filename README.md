# Truce Wallet

A smart crypto wallet that actually helps you make better decisions.

---

## What is Truce Wallet?

Truce Wallet is a multi-chain wallet built on BlockDAG that combines secure storage, token swapping, and AI-powered insights in one clean interface.

Store your crypto, swap tokens, stake for rewards, and get intelligent recommendations—all without leaving the app.

Think of it as your crypto command center: wallet, exchange, and financial advisor rolled into one.

## The Problem

Most crypto wallets do one of two things:
- They're secure but complicated
- They're simple but lack features

Meanwhile, users are stuck:
- Managing multiple wallets across different chains
- Switching between apps just to swap tokens
- Making trades based on gut feeling instead of data
- Missing out on staking rewards because it's too confusing
- Getting overwhelmed by technical jargon

The barrier to entry is still too high, and even experienced users waste time navigating fragmented tools.
